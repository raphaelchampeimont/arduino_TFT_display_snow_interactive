# arduino_TFT_display_snow_interactive
Interactive snow animation on a touch screen driven by an Arduino

It is a touch screen interactive variant of https://github.com/raphaelchampeimont/arduino_TFT_display_snow.

I used this hardware:
* Adafruit RA8875 https://www.adafruit.com/product/1590
* Adafruit 7.0" 40-pin TFT Display - 800x480 with Touchscreen https://www.adafruit.com/product/2354
* Arduino: I tested both Arduino Uno Rev3 and Arduino Wifi Rev2 (which is based on Atmega 4809)
